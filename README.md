CookedRabbit is a simple RabbitMQ wrapper for dealing with channels and connection headaches. It also shows you the natural evolution to common everyday problems with RabbitMQ implementations and how to avoid them. This solution is more orientated to services.  

RabbitMQ as a Service with lightweight dazzle : RaaS ***L dazzle***

Everything starts in the Demo client. Biggest problem I have observed so far is the storing of IModels (RabbitMQ object that represents channels) in containers/ICollections. Makes code prone to memory leaks, thus I thought a good candidate for abstraction. The examples in the CookedRabbit.Demo demonstrate very rudimentary usages of RabbitMQ. It's not supposed to be rocket science. The library is the simplification, removal, and abstraction of common usage code when wrapping RabbitMQ DotNetClient. It continues to add complexity and simplification at the same time in the RabbitBus & RabbitService.

Inspired by the likes of RawRabbit (https://github.com/pardahlman/RawRabbit), I needed a simpler RabbitMQ solution at times for specific situations. The longterm goal is to be modern, lightweight, and KISS. If you need a more thorough/advanced solution, I highly recommend checking out RawRabbit or EastyNetQ.

### Why use CookedRabbit?

<details><summary>Click to show!</summary>
<p>

Do or do not, I am not really bothered either way :).  

CookedRabbit benefits are simplicity. It will also stay current with .Net Framework, NetCore, C#7.x+, and the RabbitMQ client. It is not my intention to let things lag behind Pivotal RabbitMQ or Microsoft releases.

Which leads me to the custom compiled RabbitMQ CookedRabbit uses and includes in this solution:

```
RabbitMQ Dotnet Client 5.1.0 (6/23/2018)

Changes from Official Release
   All NuGets updated.
   NetFramework 4.5/4.5.1 -> 4.7.2
   NetStandard 1.5 -> 2.0
   NetCore 2.0 -> 2.1
   C# 7.3 (latest version)
   ApiGen re-compiled.
   Client compiled as x64.
```

CookedRabbit is in active rapid development.  
CookedRabbit supports SSL/TLS.
CookedRabbit supports LZ4 compression.  
CookedRabbit supports Utf8Json and ZeroFormat serialization.  
CookedRabbit provides async/await around RabbitMQ calls.  
CookedRabbit will be Dependency Injection friendly.  
CookedRabbit services support an optional ILogger from Microsoft.Extensions.Logger.  
CookedRabbit supports logic based customizations.  
CookedRabbit has fairly decent commenting.  
CookedRabbit has a generated Wiki.  
CookedRabbit has a plethora of examples on how to use in the Demo project, Tests project, and Benchmark project.  
CookedRabbit has throughput benchmarks.

### Getting Started

<details><summary>Click to show!</summary>
<p>

#### Configuring RabbitMQ Server First (if running Local)
To run .Demo locally, have Erlang 20.3 and Server RabbitMQ v3.7.x installed locally and running first.
Use the HTTP API management from RabbitMQ to verify communication is occurring.
The WarmupAsync() will create the queue '001' to work with, if it doesn't exist, and send/receive a test message.

Developed/Tested On

  * Erlang 20.3
  * RabbitMQ Server v3.7.5 (pre-7/6/2018)
  * RabbitMQ Server v3.7.7 (post-7/6/2018)

#### Configuration Values
Checkout the RabbitSeasoning to configure your RabbitService/RabbitTopologyService.

#### NetFramework Requirements

<details><summary>Click to show!</summary>
<p>

 * Visual Studio 2017+ installed (Community+).
 * .NET 4.7.2 SDK installed.
 * Compile as C# 7.2+ minimum.

</p>
</details>

#### NetCore Requirements

<details><summary>Click to show!</summary>
<p>

 * Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2017+ installed.
 * Open Folder `NetCore` or open the SLN.
 * Compile as C# 7.2+ minimum.
 * NetCore 2.1.0 SDK installed.

*Note: (NetCore runtime 2.1.1 seems buggy at this time)*
